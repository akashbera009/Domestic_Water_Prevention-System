# Domestic Water Wastage Prevention System

This project is a **Domestic Water Wastage Prevention System** that interfaces with Firebase Firestore to manage water flow data, control servo gates, and facilitate user payments through a React frontend. The system encompasses various functionalities, including:
- **Servo Control**: For opening and closing the servo-controlled gate.
- **WaterFlow Data**: For displaying real-time water usage and flow rate.
- **Payment Integration**: Users can make payments for the services offered by the Domestic Water Wastage Prevention System through Razorpay, supporting multiple payment methods and providing instant confirmation of transactions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **ServoControl**: Allows the admin to open and close a gate by controlling the servo motor. This updates the `servoState` field in Firestore.
2. **WaterFlow**: Displays the water flow data, including `flowRate` and `totalUsage`, fetched from the Firestore `WaterFlow` collection in real-time.

---

## Features

- **Servo Control**: Open and close the gate using buttons that update the Firestore `servoState` field.
- **Real-Time Water Data**: Fetch and display real-time `flowRate` and `totalUsage` from Firestore, with automatic updates upon changes.
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Seamless interaction with Firebase for fetching and updating data.
- **Payment Integration**:  Users can make payments for the services offered by the Domestic Water Wastage Prevention System through Razorpay, supporting multiple payment methods and providing instant confirmation of transactions

---

## Technologies Used

- **React** (18.x)
- **Firebase** (Firestore)
- **React Router** (for routing)
- **Vite** (for fast builds)
- **Razorpay** (for Payment Integration)

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/waterflow-management-system.git
cd waterflow-management-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase init functions
cd functions
npm install firebase-admin

npm i firebase
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js
npm install react-scroll
npm install dotenv
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

Ensure you have a Firebase project set up with Firestore. You need two collections:
- **WaterFlow**: With documents `Sensor1` (for `flowRate`, `totalUsage`) and `ServoControl` (for `servoState`).

---

## Firebase Configuration

Set up Firebase by providing your Firebase project's credentials.

1. Go to `src/firebase/waterflow.jsx` and replace the Firebase configuration object with your own:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

2. Ensure your Firestore database has the following structure:
   ```
   users[ 
       user1[ 
           currentMonth[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ], 
           jan24[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ], 
           feb24[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ] 
       ], 
       user2[ 
           currentMonth[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ], 
           jan24[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ], 
           feb24[ 
               servoControl[servoState:1], 
               waterflowSensor[totalusages:214] 
           ] 
       ] 
   ]

   admin[ 
       limit[max:200,penalty:150, regular:100], 
       price[penaltyPrice:2, regularPrice:0.4], 
       01ListOfAdmin[admins:["admin@gmail.com", "admin2@gmail.com"]] 
       currentMonthAdmin[currentMonth:'oct'] 
   ]
   ```

---

## Usage

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

- **Servo Control**: Open/close the gate using the buttons in the `ServoControl` component.
- **Water Flow Data**: Real-time display of `flowRate` and `totalUsage` in the `WaterFlow` component, with updates whenever changes occur in Firestore.

---

## Payment Integration

The project includes payment functionality using **Razorpay**. The integration allows users to make payments for the services offered by the Domestic Water Wastage Prevention System.

1. Ensure you have your Razorpay credentials, which should be added in the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY=YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY
   ```

2. In your payment component, initialize Razorpay using the credentials and handle the payment process.

3. Refer to the Razorpay documentation for detailed integration steps.
